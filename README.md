# COVID-analysis
NLP based summarization and clustering of COVID-related research.

### Dataset
[CORD-19: The Covid-19 Open Research Dataset](https://allenai.org/data/cord-19)
CORD-19 is a free resource of tens of thousands of scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses for use by the global research community.
The data was pulled in August 2020 and has ~19,000 research papers.

### Analysis

#### Clustering and Topic Modelling
Identify the optimal number of clusters for this dataset using k-means clustering. Then perform topic modelling for the number of clusters from clustering analysis. 

#### Abstractive summarization
Build abstractive summaries on papers using [BertAbs](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm) and BERT-Base uncased model.
